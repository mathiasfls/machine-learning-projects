# List of my Projects

1. [Text mining with Amazon’s book review data](https://github.com/yusuzech/machine-learning-projects/blob/master/amazon_text_mining/Presentation.pdf)
•	Scraped Amazon’s book price and reviews. Used tidytext package in R to remove stop words and tokenlize documents. Created word clouds and network graphs to display the most frequent words and connections between words in different type of reviews.
•	Performed sentiment analysis using Google’s Natural Language API. Built a non-linear model to predict rating for unrated new books with MSE of 0.5.

2. [Population clustering using CDC’s 2016 Annual Survey Data](https://github.com/yusuzech/machine-learning-projects/blob/master/cdc_clustering/homework.md) 
•	Used ggplot for data visualization and discovered prevalent epidemic diseases in the states.
•	Performed PCA for dimension reduction and K-Means algorithm for clustering. Generated clusters in the population with distinct health conditions and found correlations between behaviors and chronic diseases. 

3. [Bad Loan Prediction with Lending Club’s data](https://github.com/yusuzech/machine-learning-projects/blob/master/LendingClubML.ipynb)  
•	Used R for data cleaning, missing-data imputation and data transformation. Using H2O package, applied Neural Network, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and other algorithms to predict bad loans.
•	Compared and calculated variable importance for each model, the best model achieved accuracy of 67.8%.

1. Clustering [svm](https://github.com/yusuzech/machine-learning-projects/blob/master/clustering/iris_svm.ipynb);[kmeans](https://github.com/yusuzech/machine-learning-projects/blob/master/clustering/Kmeans%20Cluster%20Iris.ipynb)  
•	Use SVM and K-means algorithm to create clusters with iris dataset.
